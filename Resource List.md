# Resource List

This is a story all about how....

## CSS Resources

A small list of tools used

### Bootstrap 4

[Docs](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)    |    [Demos](https://codepen.io/tag/bootstrap%204/)    Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

### Sass

[Docs](http://sass-lang.com/)    | [Demos](http://sass-lang.com/guide)   Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.



## JavaScript Resources

Some of the best resources I have found with basic examples and links to documentation.

### NodeJS

[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/)     Most of the item we will be working have been working for a while now, so as long as the node version is greater than 4.0 we should be good.

### Gulp

[Docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md)     |    [Demo](https://arrowconsulting.sharepoint.com/Development-Wiki/SitePages/Gulp%20Sitecore%20Example.aspx)   Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.

### Owl Carousel 2

[Docs](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/)   |    [Demos](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/demos.html)    Touch enabled jQuery plugin that lets you create a beautiful responsive carousel slider.

### GSAP

[Docs](https://greensock.com/docs/#/HTML5/)    |    [Demos](http://codepen.io/GreenSock/)    Think of GSAP as the Swiss Army Knife of javascript animation...but better. It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, canvas library objects, SVG, generic objects, whatever) and it solves countless browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery), including automatic GPU-acceleration of transforms. See the ["Why GSAP?"](https://greensock.com/why-gsap/) article for details. Most other libraries only animate CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, GSAP is the most robust high-performance javascript animation library on the planet, which is probably why Google recommends it for JS-based animations and every major ad network excludes it from file size calculations. Unlike monolithic frameworks that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want.

### MixItUp

[Docs](https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/)    |    [Demos](https://www.kunkalabs.com/tutorials/category/mixitup/)    A high-performance, dependency-free library for animated filtering, sorting, insertion, removal and more... **MixItUp** gives you beautiful animated DOM manipulation on top of native CSS layout.

### ApproveJS

[Docs](http://charlgottschalk.co.za/projects/approvejs)    |    [Demos](http://charlgottschalk.co.za/projects/approvejs/demo)     Simple JavaScript validation that doesn't interfere

## Terminal

If you have any need for a good terminal experience, command prompt for you pc users, then it would be best to get something that would work with you.

### Babun

[Download and Docs](http://babun.github.io/) I recommend after this has installed pin it to your tool bar. ( I have not figured out where the exe is located and find it easier to have it in the tool bar. )

### iTerm2 

For all the mac people I prefer [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) and installing [OhMyZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/). OhMyZSH adds some nice features to terminal and better personalization options.
